        Remember when iTunes was the go-to for managing music files and Limewire (RIP) was the norm? I had around 50 GB of music from burned CDs and other sources (hopefully the statute of limitations is up on that). Apple Music came along and introduced streaming music and made it easier to manage my music library. At first, Apple Music had an option to convert MP3 files to M4A files, which worked great in the beta version. But then, the next update broke this functionality, making ~2GBs of prime Weezy F. Baby, Dipset, and Blink 182 incompatible with Apple Music.

        To be conspiratorial, this issue occurred around the time of Batterygate (when Apple purposefully reduced battery life on older iPhone models with new software updates). Also, when I was using Apple Intelligence for proofreading this paragraph, it rewrote this section as
        "I've heard that Apple accidentally reduced battery life on older iPhone models with new software updates and later corrected it."
        <br><br>
        Anyway, I've been gradually re-downloading my music files as I discovered they're no longer compatible. I searched for free tools online that would do this and came up short, so this is my long-overdue solution to recovering these files.

        The core issue was that my audio files had their codecs incorrectly labeled with an <code>.m4a</code> file extension (their container). After an Apple Music update, the software started trusting the <code>.m4a</code> label more strictly, leading to a mismatch because it expected AAC-encoded content (typical for <code>.m4a</code>) but found MP3 data instead. This made the files unplayable.
        <br><br>
        Understanding the difference between a <b>codec</b> and a <b>container</b> is key here. The image below illustrates the general encoding process:

        Essentially, the codec (like MP3 or AAC) is the recipe for compressing and decompressing the audio. The container (like <code>.m4a</code> or <code>.mp3</code>) is just the box it's stored in, and its label (the file extension) is just a hint.
        <br><br>
        As you can see in the macOS "Get Info" panel (example below), the system often displays information based on the file extension (the container's label) rather than deep-inspecting the actual codec of the audio stream within. So, even if the content was MP3, if the extension was <code>.m4a</code>, that's what "Get Info" would often reflect for the 'Kind' of file.

        **Requirements**
        - Install ffmpeg & ffprobe via Homebrew:
        ```bash
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```

        **Steps**
        1. **Unzip** the downloaded `M4A Fix Toolkit` zip.
        2. **Open Terminal** and navigate:
        ```bash
        cd /path/to/unzipped/folder
        ```
        3. **Make scripts executable**: 
        ```bash
        chmod +x check_audio_files.sh rename_m4a_to_mp3.sh fix_mismatched_files.sh
        ```
        4. **Check mismatches**:
        ```bash
        ./check_audio_files.sh "/path/to/music/folder" "$HOME/Desktop/mismatches.txt"
        ```
        5. **Rename mislabeled files**:
        ```bash
        ./rename_m4a_to_mp3.sh "/path/to/music/folder" "$HOME/Desktop/renamed_files.log"
        ```
        6. **Fix encoding mismatches**:
        ```bash
        ./fix_mismatched_files.sh "$HOME/Desktop/mismatches.txt"
        ```
